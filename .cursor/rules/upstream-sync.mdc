# Upstream Sync Enforcement

- Follow `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC_RULES.md` when reconciling with `docker/metadata-action` (v5.x).
- Preserve git-only/offline behavior: no `@actions/github` or GitHub API calls; prefer git CLI and workflow event payloads.
- Ensure version numbers match the upstream tag being mirrored and rebuild `dist/` after changes.
